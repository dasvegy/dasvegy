### Hi, I’m Konstantin ✨
I’m a self-taught developer who enjoys building tools and small games.  
Most of my projects are experiments to learn, improve, and have fun.

I’ve got a bunch of [projects](https://github.com/dasvegy?tab=repositories).\
🔧 I'm currently working on: [Betterer-Twitch-Notifier](https://github.com/dasvegy/Betterer-Twitch-Notifier).

### 📦Some of my Projects are:
- **[Betterer-Twitch-Notifier](https://github.com/dasvegy/Betterer-Twitch-Notifier)** — Customizable Twitch notification tool  
- **[YTtoMP4](https://github.com/dasvegy/YTtoMP4)** — Simple YouTube Video downloader  
- **[Kaesebroetchen](https://github.com/dasvegy/Kaesebroetchen)** — My simple Discord bot built with PyCord
