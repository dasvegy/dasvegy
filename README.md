### Hi, I’m Konstantin ✨
I’m a self-taught developer who enjoys building tools.  
Most of my projects are experiments to learn, improve, and have fun.

📁 I’ve got a bunch of [projects](https://github.com/dasvegy?tab=repositories).\
🚧 I'm currently working on: [Betterer-Twitch-Notifier](https://github.com/dasvegy/Betterer-Twitch-Notifier).
